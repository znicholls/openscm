Questions as I write:
- Should stepping a model forward do the timesteps given in

Decisions as I write:
- A model should take in a time array, and check that it matches with its internal timestep. Models shouldn't interpolate internally, that should be somewhere else in pre-processing. Models should also use regular timesteps. This means that months don't work (they vary in length and by year). Years also don't really make sense as they (strictly) vary in length. Hence most models should be working in days or minutes or hours or seconds (yes, strictly, these all also vary in length but those variations are sufficiently small not to matter). If people want to convert back to human calendars later, they can do so but that should also be a pre/post-processing step.
