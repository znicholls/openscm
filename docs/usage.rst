Usage
=====

OpenSCM defines and provides three interfaces for its users.

Its **low-level** interface is targeted to users who want to include OpenSCM in their model, e.g. integrated assessment modellers. This interface provides the basic functionality necessary to run all SCMs included in OpenSCM. It includes functions for getting and setting parameters as well as to run and reset the model.

The **high-level** interface adds several convinience functions on top of the low-level interface. It allows for reading and writing parameters from and to a standardized and other file formats, including whole scenario definitions. Also, it provides functions for running ensembles of model runs and doing stochastic analyses and model tuning.

The **command line** interface lets users run models with specified parameters and model input directly from the command line without coding themselves. Please see :ref:`tool` for its usage documentation.


.. _parameters:

Parameters
----------

**Parameter** here refers to any named input or output variable of a model. A parameter can be either scalar (i.e. a single number) or a timeseries and has a unique name in a hierarchy of arbitrary depth. That means every parameter either is a root parameter without a parent parameter ("level 0") or belongs to a parent parameter.

For example, the parameter for industrial carbon emissions belongs to the parameter for carbon emissions, which in turn belongs to the root parameter emission. Thus, it is identified by

    ``Emissions`` -> ``CO2`` -> ``Industrial``.

In the low-level API parameters are expected to be identified by tuples of strings describing their position in the hierarchy, i.e. in this example ``("Emissions", "CO2", "Industrial")``. The high-level API also allows for giving it as a string with the hierarchical levels separated by ``|``, e.g. ``"Emissions|CO2|Industrial"``.

See :ref:`parameter-hierarchy` for the standard parameters in OpenSCM.


.. _timeframes:

Time frames
-----------

Timeseries parameters are always given with a corresponding time frame, which consists of a time point and a period length. The time point gives the start of the timeseries; the period length gives the length of the period between consecutive values in the timeseries. Each parameter value is assumed to be the **average value** for its corresponding period. This implies that additive values such as emissions need to be given as a rate, e.g. ``tC/a`` rather than ``tC``.

In the low-level API time points are given in seconds since ``1970-01-01 00:00:00``, while time period lengths are specified in seconds. The high-level API additionally accepts string values and ``datetime.datetime`` objects.

Setting up a model run
**********************

A model run is represented by a :class:`openscm.core.Core` object specifying the underlying SCM and start and end time:

.. code:: python

    from openscm.core import Core as ModelRun
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    start_time = datetime(2006, 1, 1).timestamp()
    year_seconds = timedelta(365).total_seconds()
    # use year_seconds since models do not account for leap years
    end_time = start_time + (2100 - 2006) * year_seconds
    model_run = ModelRun("DICE", start_time, end_time)

Setting input parameters
************************

In the low-level API parameters are get and set through of subclasses of :class:`ParameterView`. While the values of the parameters are stored internaly, a :class:`ParameterView` provides an (always up-to-date) "view" of the corresponding parameter giving the parameter values in a specific unit and, in the case of timeseries, a specific time frame.

Unit and time frame have to be specified questing a :class:`~openscm.core.ParameterView` from :class:`~openscm.core.Core`'s :class:`~openscm.core.ParameterSet` property called ``parameters`` using one of the following functions:

- :func:`~openscm.core.ParameterSet.get_scalar_view` returns a read-only view to a scalar parameter (:class:`~openscm.core.ScalarView`)
- :func:`~openscm.core.ParameterSet.get_timeseries_view` returns a read-only view to a timeseries parameter (:class:`~openscm.core.TimeseriesView`)
- :func:`~openscm.core.ParameterSet.get_writable_scalar_view` returns a writable view to a scalar parameter (:class:`~openscm.core.WritableScalarView`)
- :func:`~openscm.core.ParameterSet.get_writable_timeseries_view` returns a writable view to a timeseries parameter (:class:`~openscm.core.WritableTimeseriesView`)

Each of these functions take the hierarchical name of the parameter (as described under :ref:`parameters`) and, in a similar fashion, the hierarchical name of the region it applies to or an empty tuple, ``()``, in case the parameter applies to all regions.

Values can be get and set using ``get`` and ``set`` (also, ``get_series`` and ``set_series`` for whole timeseries), respectively. Conversion, if necessary, is done internally by the object. There is no standard for the unit and time frame for internal storage, but those of the first :class:`ParameterView` requested are used. If a scalar view for a time series is requested (or vice-versa), or if the units are not convertible, an error is raised.

:class:`~openscm.core.ParameterView` objects also convert between hierarchical levels if possible: a view to a higher level parameter yields the sum of its child parameters. This implies that, once a *writable* view to a parameter is requested, there cannot be a view to one of its children. Otherwise consostency cannot be guaranteed, so an error is raised. The same holds if a child parameter has already been set and the user tries to set values for one of its parent parameters. A similar logic applies to the hierarchy of regions.

Using :class:`~openscm.core.ParameterView` as proxy objects rather than directly setting/returning parameter valus allows for efficient parameter handling in the expected units and time frames without specifying these for each value (e.g. seeting a timeseries step-wise would create large overhead).

.. code:: python

    climate_sensitivity = model_run.parameters.get_writable_scalar_view(("Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity"), (), "°C")
    climate_sensitivity.set(3)

    carbon_emissions_raw = [10 for _ in range(2100 - 2006)]
    carbon_emissions = model_run.parameters.get_writable_timeseries_view(("Emissions", "CO2"), (), "GtCO2/a", start_time, year_seconds)
    carbon_emissions.set_series(carbon_emissions_raw)

Running the model
*****************

The model is simply run by calling the :func:`~openscm.core,Core.run` function:

.. code:: python

    model_run.run()

This tells the adapter for the particular SCM to get the necessary parameters in the format as expected by the model, while conversion for units and time frames is done by the corresponding :class:`ParameterView` objects. It then runs the model itself.

After the run the model is reset, so the :func:`~openscm.core.Core.run` function can be called again (setting parameters to new values before, if desired).

Getting output parameters
*************************

During the run the model adapter sets the output parameters just like the input parameters were set above. Thus, these can be read using read-only :class:`~openscm.core.ParameterView` objects:

.. code:: python

    gmt = model_run.parameters.get_timeseries_view(("Temperature", "Surface"), (), "°C", start_time, year_seconds)
    print(gmt.get_series())
